## Description

FlowState is a beautifully minimal journaling app designed for people who want to write without distraction. Inspired by clean, intentional design, FlowState gives you a focused space to capture your thoughts, track your moods, and build a lasting journaling habit.

YOUR THOUGHTS, YOUR DEVICE

Every word you write stays on your device. FlowState stores all data locally using Apple's SwiftData framework. There are no accounts to create, no servers to trust, and no data leaving your phone. Optional iCloud sync lets you access your journal across devices using Apple's own infrastructure.

WRITE WITHOUT FRICTION

Open the app and start writing. The journal editor is clean and focused, showing you a live word and character count as you go. Built-in spell checking helps you write with confidence.

TRACK HOW YOU FEEL

Each entry includes simple mood tracking. Choose from five states -- happy, calm, sad, frustrated, or thoughtful -- and watch your emotional patterns emerge over time in the weekly overview.

CAPTURE MOMENTS

Attach up to 10 photos to any journal entry. Your photos are stored locally and never uploaded to third-party servers.

SEE YOUR PATTERNS

The weekly overview gives you a clear visual summary of your journaling activity and mood trends through elegant charts. The weekly review offers deeper insights with mood breakdowns, writing trends, and reflection prompts.

BUILD THE HABIT

FlowState tracks your journaling streak to keep you motivated. Set daily reminders at the time that works for you, and build a consistent practice of self-reflection.

TAKE YOUR DATA WITH YOU

Export your journal entries as plain text or JSON whenever you want. Your data belongs to you.
